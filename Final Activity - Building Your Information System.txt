Final Project: Building Your Information System
Below are 8 distinct scenarios for your final project. Each group will build an Information System to solve one of these problems. Each group, with at most 4 students, must pick a scenario that has not yet been selected twice beforehand.
Once your group has decided on a scenario, the group leader must then put a class comment in the class activity containing the name of the system and the full name and email address used in the google classroom of each group member, for example:
Peer Tutoring System
1. Juan Amazing Dela Cruz (juana.delacruz@gmail.com)
2. John Sample Doe (johns.doe@gmail.com)
3. Jane Sample Doe (janes.doe@gmail.com)
Each group must present their Information System, either online or face-to-face, before Christmas break. The presentation must, at least, cover the features and system architecture used in its implementation.
1. Peer Tutoring Matching System
This system should accept tutoring requests from students via a form, capturing their name, email, and subject.
The system shall maintain a database of registered tutors and their available subjects.
The system must automatically find an available tutor who matches the requested subject.
Upon finding a match, the system must log the match and automatically notify the tutor via email.
2. Club Budget & Reimbursement System
This system should allow club leaders to submit funding or reimbursement requests via a form.
The system shall maintain a database of clubs, their current budgets, and their advisor's email.
All new requests must be logged with a "Pending" status and automatically routed to the correct advisor for approval.
The system must provide a way for the advisor to approve or deny requests (e.g., via email links).
Upon approval, the system must automatically update the request's status and deduct the approved amount from the club's budget.
3. Library/Lab Room Booking System
This system should allow students to request a specific resource (e.g., room, equipment) for a defined start and end time.
The system shall maintain a database of all confirmed bookings.
The system must automatically check all new requests against the existing bookings database to prevent time-slot conflicts.
If no conflict exists, the booking shall be confirmed, and the student notified.
If a conflict exists, the booking shall be rejected, and the student notified of the failure.
4. Employee "Kudos" (Staff Recognition) System
This system should provide a form for any employee to submit "kudos" (praise) for a colleague, capturing the recipient's email and a message.
The system shall maintain a directory of employees that includes their email and their manager's email.
All "kudos" submissions must be logged in a database.
The system must automatically look up the recipient's manager.
The system must immediately send two notification emails: one to the recipient and one to their manager.
5. Automated Homework Extension Request
This system should allow students to request a homework extension via a form.
The system shall maintain a database of students and their eligibility for an automatic, one-time extension.
The system must check the student's eligibility upon submission.
If the student is eligible, the request shall be automatically approved, their eligibility status updated, and the request logged.
If the student is not eligible, the request's status shall be set to "Pending," and the teacher must be automatically notified for a manual review.
6. Event Volunteer Sign-up & Hour Tracker
This system should provide a form for volunteers to sign up for specific jobs and time slots.
The system shall maintain a database of available jobs, their maximum capacity (number of slots), and all confirmed sign-ups.
The system must automatically check if the chosen job is full.
If slots are available, the volunteer shall be confirmed, and a confirmation email sent.
If the job is full, the sign-up shall be rejected, and a notification email sent.
The system must log the hours for each volunteer's completed shift.
7. Student Laptop/Equipment Loan System
This system should allow IT staff to log equipment checkouts via a form, capturing the item, student, and due date.
The system shall maintain a database of all equipment and its status ("Available" or "On Loan").
The system must log all active loans.
When an item is checked out, its status in the equipment database must be automatically updated to "On Loan".
The system must run a scheduled daily check to find all loans where the due date has passed.
The system must automatically send "Overdue" reminder emails to students with past-due items.
8. Project Proposal Submission & Review Tool
This system should allow students to submit project proposals via a form.
All submissions shall be logged in a database with a default "Pending" status.
The system must automatically notify the professor of a new submission.
The system must provide a mechanism for the professor to update the proposal's status (e.g., "Approved" or "Revisions Needed").
The system must automatically notify the student of the professor's final decision.
